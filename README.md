<h1>3D Renderer in C++ using Apple Metal API</h1>

<p>I created this project to better understand how 3D objects are rendered on the GPU. I created a Renderer in C++ and a Renderer Adapter in Objective C++ to be able to utilize Apple Metal's objects and methods, which are written in Objective C. I created my own Vertex and Fragment shader functions for the cube. The vertex function changes the position of the vertices based on the position of the mouse. You can see the effect here: </p>
